# Titanic-ML-Project
A machine learning project aimed at predicting deaths in the Titanic disaster.

# Titanic Data Analysis

This repository contains the Python script `titanic.py`, which is designed to perform data analysis or predictive modeling on the Titanic dataset. The dataset contains demographics and passenger information from the Titanic, a historical dataset often used for introduction to data science and machine learning.

## Features

- Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Analysis of passenger demographics and survival rates.
- Predictive modeling to estimate survival chances of the Titanic passengers.
- Visualizations of key statistics and predictions.
- Utilization of scikit-learn for machine learning models.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, you'll need to have the following:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms.
- Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization (optional).

Install the required libraries with the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

## Installation
To start using this script, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ranuelyn/titanic-data-analysis.git
```
---
Navigate to the script's directory:
```bash
cd titanic-data-analysis
```

## Usage
Run the titanic.py script by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python titanic.py
```

The script will process the Titanic dataset and output the analysis and predictions to your console or a file, based on how the script is configured.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data structures and data analysis tools.
- NumPy: For scientific computing with Python.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For plotting graphs and data visualizations.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
